<!-- I decided to make JetBrains MPS the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-JetBrains-MPS) as JetBrains MPS is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the JetBrains MPS programming language. It only makes sense to JetBrains MPS the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here. !-->
